Aug 01 10:22:06.842 [notice] We compiled with OpenSSL 101010bf: OpenSSL 1.1.1k  25 Mar 2021 and we are running with OpenSSL 101010bf: 1.1.1k. These two versions should be binary compatible.
Aug 01 10:22:06.843 [notice] Tor 0.4.5.9 running on Linux with Libevent 2.1.11-stable, OpenSSL 1.1.1k, Zlib 1.2.11, Liblzma N/A, Libzstd N/A and Glibc 2.31 as libc.

Aug 01 10:22:06.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 5% (conn): Connecting to a relay
Aug 01 10:22:07.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 10% (conn_done): Connected to a relay
Aug 01 10:22:07.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 14% (handshake): Handshaking with a relay
Aug 01 10:22:08.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 15% (handshake_done): Handshake with a relay done
Aug 01 10:22:08.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 20% (onehop_create): Establishing an encrypted directory connection
Aug 01 10:22:08.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 25% (requesting_status): Asking for networkstatus consensus
Aug 01 10:22:08.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 30% (loading_status): Loading networkstatus consensus
Aug 01 10:22:11.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.
Aug 01 10:22:12.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 40% (loading_keys): Loading authority key certs
Aug 01 10:22:12.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.
Aug 01 10:22:12.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45% (requesting_descriptors): Asking for relay descriptors
Aug 01 10:22:12.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/6903, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
Aug 01 10:22:13.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 50% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
Aug 01 10:22:15.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
