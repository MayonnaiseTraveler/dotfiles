# ![alt text](img/rss_32.png) RSS Finder

An extension that scrapes each page that you visit in turn for any active RSS or Atom urls and presents them as a list for you to copy for use with news readers and aggregators.

Current behaviours:

* Standard page scraping for meta tags pointing to application/rss+xml or application/atom+xml
* Scraping of YouTube pages to obtain the link to the lesser known feeds behind each channel

More features to come.

Free.
