            Hi <strong>professor</strong>, in case you're reading this, i just
            want to tell you how i've made this website! <br />
            actually i'm using php to make this just so i don't have to manually
            copy and paste the same pieces of code on every webpage and all that
            stuff, but there's a twist, i'm using a python script to convert php
            int pure html and then just cleaning up the code a bit. Also i've
            already made the css of the website aswell, if you think i should
            change anything or have any good advice fell free to tell me! hope
            you like the website!
